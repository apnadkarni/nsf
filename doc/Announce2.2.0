New Features

- NSF:

    + NsfHasTclSpace: ...
    + substdefault for properties and variables: make behaviour of
    per-object and per-class substdefaults consistent, early check for
    complete substitution scripts, ...
  * Performance improvements:
    + The lookup for (bytecode-compiled) object variables is now
    supported by a lookup cache to avoid repeated linear searches.
    + The number of string comparisons (strcmp) was reduced
    systematically, in method-parameter parsing and method-parameter
    handling.

- NX:

  * Improvements to incremental property methods: value=add and
    value=delete

  * Improvements to ensemble methods:
    + Fix ensemble-method dispatch via colon dispatcher
    + [current nextmethod] + [current isnextcall] are now fully aware

    Preliminary support for a future Tcl 8.7 (as of Dec 2, 2016;
    commit 71fa1f9c91). NSF compiles under 8.7a0 and its regression
    tests execute successfully.

  * Misc (esp. NSF/C):

    + Reduced memory consumption via better member aligning of
    structs, esp. on 64-bit machines.
    + Bug fix: Avoid preemptive frees on %proc subsitution for
    forwarder methods.
    + Aliases: Avoid Tcl_obj re-creations

  * New configure option: "--enable-development=test"

  * Extended regression test suite:
    The test suite contains (for Tcl 8.6.8) now xxxx tests.

- Packaging & distribution:

  * Initial support for the new nmake system of TEA (TIP 477) and MSVC
    1914 (VS 2017; win/makefile.vc); various fixes to install target.
