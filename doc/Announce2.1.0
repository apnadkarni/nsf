Dear Community,

We are pleased to announce the availability of the Next Scripting
Framework (NSF) 2.1.0.

This is a maintenance release. Since the release of 2.0.0, there have
been more than 360 commits to our code repository. The Next Scripting
Framework was tested with Tcl 8.5.19 and Tcl 8.6.6 on Linux, Mac OS X,
and in Windows enviroments (MinGW, VC).

Diff stats since 2.0.0:

171 files changed, 30137 insertions(+), 13932 deletions(-)   

Major changes relative to 2.0.0 are:

a) 

b) 

c) 

d) Improved robustness:

   * Tcl command resolvers and command literals:

   Up to and including Tcl 8.6.6, there were subtle and unwanted
   interactions between Tcl's command resolvers in certain corner
   cases (which are used by NSF dispatcher for colon-prefixed messages
   and helper commands) and Tcl's command literals. The issue and patches
   were reported upstream to the Tcl core by Gustaf Neumann and will
   enter an upcoming patch release (8.6.7). Our regression test-suite
   was extended accordingly to track the issue.

h) Code changes (C):

     comparisons as flagged by the following gcc/clang flags (ensure

     -Wfloat-conversion -Wsign-compare.
   * Reduced variable scopes.

i) Packaging: Updated TEA to 3.10
