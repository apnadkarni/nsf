Run the script e.g. via the following command:

   sudo dtrace -q -F -s dtrace/timestamps.d -c "./nxsh tests/object-system.test"

Hints:

* Make sure that a "package require nx" works for root as well
  (install nx, or provide a TCLLIBPATH, etc.).  

* If dtrace compliation fails (e.g. "... nsf*:::method-entry does not
  match any probes", start an nxsh in a different window to make the
  probes known to the kernel.
